squashmount - mount certain directories with squashfs + overlay/aufs/...

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=over 8

=item B<squashmount> [options] I<command> [I<mask1> I<mask2> ...]

Where I<command> is one of B<mount>, B<umount>, B<remount>, B<set>, B<reset>,
B<status>, B<forget>, B<print->I<...>

To see the full manual, type B<squashmount man>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

For each configured mount-point (resp. if I<mask1>, I<mask2>, ... are given,
for all mount-points whose tag matches at least one of the masks),
the corresponding directory is mounted readonly, using squash as a readonly
filesystem and additionally using overlay/aufs/... as a writable filesystem.

When the filesystem is umounted or remounted, the changed data is recompressed
(unless the mount-point is configured otherwise).

Normally, the init-system should call B<squashmount start> and
B<squashmount -f stop> on starting or shutdown of the system, respectively,
so that the data is regularly resquashed.
You can manually force this resquashing by calling B<squashmount remount>.

B<squashmount> reads its mount-points from F</etc/squashmount.pl> which is
documented later (the path can be changed with B<--config>).
Configured directories are created if necessary; B<squashmount> never removes
directories (not even configured temporary directories).

B<squashmount> keeps its current state in F</run/squashmount> (the path
can be changed with B<--rundir>) in a format which may depend on tools used
and which may also change in future versions of B<squashmount>.
B<squashmount> assumes that its data stored
in F</run/squashmount> and the actually mounted directories coincide, that is,
that they are not mounted/umounted without using B<squashmount> and, in
particular, that you do not reboot without calling B<squashmount stop>
and without cleaning the directory.
Therefore, if you modify F</etc/squashmount.pl> (in some cases also if you
upgrade or downgrade B<squashmount>) you must make sure to update
F</run/squashmount>; see the documentation of the B<stop> and
B<forget> commands.

B<squashmount set> can be used to set/unset certain
temporary states for the matching mount-tags into F</run/squashmount> which
will be honored during umount, stop, restart, or remount.
For example, combining with B<--no-squash> or B<--kill> you can instruct
B<squashmount> to keep or kill the new data without resquashing when
umounting, remounting, or shutting down.
The set state is kept until B<squashmount stop> or B<squashmount restart> is
executed (or until F</run> is cleaned by the system e.g. on a reboot).
In particular, this state is unchanged by B<squashmount umount>,
B<squashmount mount>, or B<squashmount remount>.
To change the state permanently, modify the definition of the mount-tag in
the configuration file F</etc/squashmount.pl> correspondingly and call
B<squashmount reset> to propagate the modification to the running system.

Each I<command> applies to all configured mount-points
(resp. to those selected by the additional B<mask1> B<mask2> ... arguments).
The following values for I<command> are available:

=over 8

=item B<mount>

Mount all configured mount-points.

This works only if the corresponding squash-file already exists.
Use B<start> or B<create> instead if you want to create the squash-file
for the first time.

=item B<umount>

Umount all configured mount-points, resquashing if data was changed
(and has reached a configured threshold).
Moreover, the modified data in the CHANGES and WORKDIR directory is removed
(the directories are "cleaned").
This command keeps the local setting made with B<squashmount set>
unless the option B<-r> (B<--reset>) is used.

=item B<remount>

This is somewhat like calling B<umount> followed by B<mount>.
This is skipped if it is neither necessary to resquash nor to delete data
(when skipping, also the option B<-r> is ignored).
Use B<--force> to omit this skipping.

=item B<create>

This is meant to be used only the first time when a mount-point is used:
It creates the squash-file from the directory DIR specified in the
configuration of that mount-point; afterwards that directory is cleaned.
If the squash-file already exists, you have to use B<--force> (and B<--quiet>
if you want to suppress the corresponding warning).

=item B<start>

This is like B<squashmount mount> with two exception:

1. If there is not yet a squash-file (that is, presumably only the first time
when this mount-point is used), B<squashmount create> is executed in advance.

2. For those mount-points for which B<RESQUASH_ON_START> is true, an
analogue of the following sequence of commands is executed

B<squashmount mount>, B<squashmount remount>, B<squashmount -n set>,
that is, a (presumably postponed) resquash happens at B<squashmount start>
and will by default not happen on subsequent B<squashmount umount> or
B<squashmount stop> commands.

=item B<stop>

This is like calling B<squashmount umount> followed by B<squashmount forget>:
After umounting it forgets all corresponding information of B<squashmount set>
for the corresponding mount-points, and if the configuration uses
temporary directories, new directories will be chosen on the next B<mount>.
Moreover, previous directories are removed according to the setting of
B<RM_CHANGE>/B<$rm_change>, B<RM_WORKDIR>/B<$rm_workdir>,
B<RM_READONLY>/B<$rm_readonly>, B<RM_DIR>/B<$rm_dir>, and B<$rm_rundir>.

In order to change F</etc/squashmount.pl> after B<squashmount mount> was called,
the safe way is to call first B<squashmount stop> (at least for the
mount-points you want to modify) and then do your modifications.

If used with B<--force> also umounted mount-points are forgotten/dirs removed.

=item B<restart>

This is like calling B<squashmount stop> followed by B<squashmount start>.
Note that in contrast to B<remount> this is executed unconditionally
(and it differs also substantially from B<squashmount --force remount>).
If used with B<--force> forget and try to mount umounted mount-points.

=item B<status> or B<list>

This outputs some general status information, depending on the verbosity level.
To output particular data use the B<print-...> commands (and specify B<mask1>).

=item B<check>

Check whether B<DIR> is empty; usually this should always be the case.
Normally, this command requires that the corresponding mount-point is umounted.
Use option B<-f> to force an umount temporarily.
In this case, B<--lazy=0> and B<--lsof=1> are the defaults unless specified
by the option.

B<check> cannot be used if B<DIR> is unknown, that is, if B<DIR> is a defined
by a function which was never called before.
You can use B<squashmount -f print-dir> in advance to force B<DIR> to be known.

=item B<set>

If combined with other options, modify the corresponding active state
of B<--backup>, B<--tempdir>, B<--compression>, B<--threshold>, and B<--kill>
in F</run/squashmount>.

=item B<reset>

Undo all effects of a previous B<set> commands for the corresponding
mount-point, according to the current F</etc/squashmount.pl>.

If you change B<BACKUP>, B<TEMPDIR>, B<COMPRESSION>, B<THRESHOLD>, or B<KILL>
for a mount-point in </etc/squashmount.pl>, use B<squashmount reset> to
activate this new setting.
For other changes on F</etc/squashmount.pl> see the description of the
B<forget> command.

=item B<forget>

This removes B<all> local configuration stored in F</run/squashmount> for
the corresponding mount-points. It works only for umounted mount-points.
(You can use F<--force> to make it work anyway, but this is very dangerous;
see below).

In order to change F</etc/squashmount.pl> after B<squashmount mount> was called
(or when changing to a different version of F<squashmount>),
the safe way is to call first B<squashmount stop>, i.e. B<squashmount umount>
followed by B<squashmount forget> (at least for the mount-points you want to
modify) and only then do your modification/upgrade F<squashmount>.

If you shortcut this (e.g. because you forgot calling B<squashmount stop>
in advance or because you cannot umount currently some reason) you have to
know more details: Changes to B<BACKUP>, B<TEMPDIR>, B<COMPRESSION>,
B<THRESHOLD>, or B<KILL> can be made active by using B<squashmount reset>.
(In case of a change of the B<squashmount> version the behavior is not defined.)
With this knowledge you should be able to call B<squashmount stop> even
after you made your changes.

If you plan to use B<forget> with the B<--force> flag on a mounted mount-point,
you must know what you are doing: B<squashmount> is then no longer aware that
the corresponding mount-point is actually mounted; you are then responsible
for umounting these mount-points without using B<squashmount>.

=item B<print-tag>

Output the tag.
This is mainly useful to get a list of all tags if you do not specify a mask.
For usage in scripts, combine this with B<-q>.

=item B<print-dir>

Output the name of the directory B<DIR> of the specified mount-point(s).
For usage in scripts, combine this with B<-q>/B<-S> and pass a tag.

=item B<print-readonly>

Output the effective B<READONLY> directory.
Output B<1> if the mount-point is configured to be non-writable.
For usage in scripts, combine this with B<-q>/B<-S> and pass a tag.

=item B<print-changes>

Output the effective B<CHANGES> directory in which the modified data is stored.
The result is undefined if the mount-point is configured to be non-writable.
For usage in scripts, combine this with B<-q>/B<-S> and pass a tag.

=item B<print-workdir>

Output the effective B<WORKDIR> directory in which the modified data is stored.
The result is undefined if the mount-point is configured to be non-writable.
For usage in scripts, combine this with B<-q>/B<-S> and pass a tag.

=item B<print-file>

Output the absolute path to the squash-file.
For usage in scripts, combine this with B<-q>/B<-S> and pass a tag.

=item B<print-type>

Output the tool actually used for mounting.
Possible output is C<overlay>, C<overlayfs>, C<overlayfs-obsolete>, C<aufs>,
C<unionfs-fuse>, C<unionfs>, C<funionfs>, C<bind>, C<readonly>, or the
empty string (for not mounted or incompletely mounted; you can check
the details with B<print-squashtype>).
For usage in scripts, combine this with B<-q> and pass a tag.

=item B<print-squashtype>

Output the tool actually used for mounting the squash file.
Possible output is C<squashfs>, C<squashfuse>, C<unknown>, or the empty string.

=item B<print-new>

Output 1 if there is new (i.e. modified) data.
For usage in scripts, combine this with B<-q> and pass a tag.

=item B<print-will-squash>

Output 1 if data will be resquashed on the next umount/remount
according to current setting and data.
For usage in scripts, combine this with B<-q> and pass a tag.

=item B<print-threshold>

Output the currently active threshold value.
For usage in scripts, combine this with B<-q> and pass a tag.

=item B<print-kill>

Output 1, -1, or 0, depending on whether B<--kill> or B<--kill-or-resquash>
is active.
For usage in scripts, combine this with B<-q> and pass a tag.

=item B<help>

Print a brief help.

=item B<man>

Show the full manual.

=back

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 8

=item B<--help> or B<-h>

Display brief help.

=item B<--man> or B<-?>

Show the full manual.

=item B<--verbose> or B<-v> (accumulative)

Verbose output.
In verbose level 3 or larger any "external" command like B<mount> is output,
its output not being suppressed.
In verbose level 4 even additional options are passed to such external commands
to make them produce verbose output. This overrides also B<--mksquash-verbose>
partially, see the subsequent description.

=item B<--mksquash-verbose=>I<string>

Determines options and redirections for B<mksquashfs> relevant for verbosity.
It can be a combination of symbols, possibly followed by flags.
Later symbols/flags combinations override earlier ones.
Unknown symbols/flag combinations are tacitly ignored.
The following symbols do exist:

=over 16

=item B<i>:
Pass option B<-info> (automatic if verbose level is 4 or larger)

=item B<n>:
Pass option B<-no-progress>

=item B<p>:
Pass option B<-progress>

=item B<q>:
Pass option B<-quiet> (unless verbose level is 4 or larger)

=item B<r>:
Redirect stdout to F</dev/null> (unless verbose level is 3 or larger)

=item B<I>, B<N>, B<P>, B<Q>, B<R>
Ignore earlier respective symbol B<i>, B<n>, B<p>, B<q>, B<r>
if there was some. For instance, B<iqI>, B<qI>, or B<q> are all equivalent.
(These symbols are useful only when combined with flags.)

=back

The following flags do exist which can be appended to a symbol
to make the previous symbols act only conditionally.

For instance, B<mksquash> does not necessarily support B<-quiet>,
so you might want to use a flag to check whether this is the case.

Using flags makes the configuration more flexible, but costs running time,
of course, since the checks have to be executed.
However, B<squashmount> caches the results of checks, so that the checks
are made at most once per call of B<squashmount>.

=over 16

=item B<1>

Use the symbol only if B<stdout> B<is> a terminal.

=item B<->

Use the symbol only if B<stdout> is B<not> a terminal.

=item B<2>

Use the symbol only if B<stderr> B<is> a terminal.

=item B<+>

Use the symbol only if B<stderr> is B<not> a terminal.

=item B<?>

Use the symbol only if the output of B<mksquash> contains B<-quiet>.

=item B<!>

Use the symbol only if the output of B<mksquash> does B<not> contain B<-quiet>.

=back

The default I<string> is user-specified in F</etc/squashmount.pl>;
if not specified there, the default is B<q?n-n+!> which means that the
B<-quiet> option is used if it is supported, and B<-no-progress> is used
if either stdout is not a terminal or if stderr is not a terminal and
the B<-quiet> option is unknown (because there were patches for such
B<mksquashfs> versions which output the progress bar to stderr).

As an artificial complex example, B<q1q2r12Q!> would mean:
if stdout or stderr is a terminal, use B<-quiet>, and if stdout and
stdout are both terminals, redirect stdout to F</dev/null>; however,
do not use B<-quiet> if B<mksquash> does not know this option.

=item B<--quiet> or B<-q> (accumulative)

Quiet output.
Use this with B<check> or B<print-...> if you want to use the output in scripts.
See also B<--separator>.

=item B<--version> or B<-V>

Print version number and exit

=item B<--config=>I<file> or B<-c> I<file> (accumulative)

Using I<file> instead of B</etc/squashmount.pl> as a config file.
If this option is repeated, all passed B<file>s are parsed in the given order.

=item B<--umount=>I<opt> or B<-u> I<opt> (accumulative)

Add option I<opt> to the default B<@umount> array (see also B<--umount-ro>).
If this option is repeated, all passed options are added to the array.
By default, this means that the option are used in the call to B<umount DIR>.
There might be code in B</etc/squashmount.pl> which treats this array value
differently (for examples, see the description of B<@umount> and B<UMOUNT>).

=item B<--umount-ro=>I<opt> or B<-U> I<opt> (accumulative)

Add option I<opt> to the default B<@umount_ro> array.
If this option is repeated, all passed options are added to the array.
By default, this means that the option are used in the call to B<umount>
when umounting a readonly directory.
There might be code in B</etc/squashmount.pl> which treats this array value
differently (for examples, see the description of B<@umount> and B<UMOUNT>).

=item B<--fumount=>I<opt> (accumulative)

Add option I<opt> to the default B<@fumount> array (see also B<--umount>).
If this option is repeated, all passed options are added to the array.
By default, this means that the option are used in the call to B<fusermount -u DIR>.
There might be code in B</etc/squashmount.pl> which treats this array value
differently.

=item B<--fumount-ro=>I<opt> (accumulative)

Add option I<opt> to the default B<@fumount_ro> array (see also B<--umount-ro>).
If this option is repeated, all passed options are added to the array.
By default, this means that the option are used in the call to
B<fusermount -u DIR> when umounting a readonly directory.
There might be code in B</etc/squashmount.pl> which treats this array value
differently.

=item B<--user>

Set all options to support user mode mounting:

=over 16

=item Use B<$HOME/.squashmount.pl> instead of B</etc/squasmount.pl>

You can avoid/change this effect by specifying B<--config>

=item Use B<$TEMPDIR/squashmount$UID> instead of B</run/squashmount>

Here, B<$TEMPDIR> defaults to B</tmp>.
You can avoid/change the effect by specifying B<--rundir>.

=item Remove all C<-o allow_other> defaults

You can avoid this effect by specifying B<--allow>

=item Use default @order = qw(unionfs-fuse!! funionfs!!)

You can avoid this effect by specifying B<--order>

=item Use default @squashorder = qw(squashfuse!!)

You can avoid this effect by specfiying B<--squashorder>

=back

=item B<--rundir=>I<dir>

Use I<dir> instead of B</run/squashmount>.

=item B<--interactive> or B<-i>

Ask for confirmation before cleaning a directory.

=item B<--order=>I<order> or B<-o> I<order>

Override the value of B<@order> from the configuration.
Any symbol which has no special meaning in I<order> can be used as a separator.
As a practical example, using B<--order=bind> with remount forces that the
corresponding mount-points are mounted readonly with --bind.

=item B<--squashorder=>I<squashorder> or B<-O> I<squashorder>

Override the value of B<@squashorder> from the configuration.
Any symbol which has no special meaning in I<squashorder>
can be used as a separator.

=item B<--no-squash> or B<--nosquash> or B<-n>

(This is an alias for B<--threshold=-1>.)
If used with B<umount> or B<remount> do not resquash the directories and
keep the new data.

If used with B<set>, set the state in F</run/squashmount>
so that this happens for all subsequent umounts/remounts.

If used with B<status> or B<print*> act as if mount-point was correspondingly
configured (without actually changing the configuration, of course).

=item B<--squash> or B<-s>

(This is an alias for B<--threshold=0> which is normally the default.)
If used with B<umount> or B<remount> squash the directories if they have
been changed. (See also B<--force-squash>.)

If used with B<set>, set the state in F</run/squashmount>
so that this happens for all subsequent umounts/remounts.

If used with B<status> or B<print*> act as if mount-point was correspondingly
configured (without actually changing the configuration, of course).

=item B<--force-squash> or B<--squash-force>

(This is an alias for B<--threshold=-2>.)
If used with B<umount> or B<remount> squash the directories,
even if they have not been changed.

=item B<--threshold=>I<size> or B<-t> I<size>

For I<size>=B<-1> act as described for B<--no-squash>, and for I<size>=B<0>
act as described for B<--squash>, and for I<size>=B<-2> act as described
for B<--force-squash>.

For positive I<size>, if the length of the changes is less than I<size> bytes,
squashmount will act with B<umount> as if B<--no-squash> is active, otherwise
it acts normally, that is, the data is resquashed.

For convenience, you can append B<k>, B<m>, B<g>, B<t> to the number to denote
kilobytes (1024), megabytes (1024^2), gigabytes (1024^3),
or terabytes (1024^4), respectively.

For the particular case that I<size> is empty the value of the current
F</etc/squashmount.pl> is taken (cf. the B<unset> command).
This is useful if B<set> has been used:

If used with B<set>, set the state in F</run/squashmount>
so that this happens for all subsequent umounts/remounts.

If used with B<status> or B<print*> act as if mount-point was correspondingly
configured (without actually changing the configuration, of course).

=item B<--kill> or B<-k>

When umounting/remounting do not resquash the data but delete all new data.
Use with care!
For safety reasons, this has no effect if the currently active B<--threshold>
value is negative.

If used with B<set>, set the B<KILL> state in F</run/squashmount> to B<1>,
so that this happens for all subsequent umounts/remounts.

If used with B<status> or B<print*> act as if mount-point was correspondingly
configured (without actually changing the configuration, of course).

=item B<--kill-or-resquash> or B<-R>

When umounting/remounting a directory whose threshold is not reached,
remove all the data.
In other words: Only major changes are stored by resquashing;
all minor changes are lost.
Use with care!
For safety reasons, this has no effect if the currently active B<--threshold>
value is negative.

If used with B<set>, set the B<KILL> state in F</run/squashmount> to B<-1>,
so that this happens for all subsequent umounts/remounts.

If used with B<status> or B<print*> act as if mount-point was correspondingly
configured (without actually changing the configuration, of course).

=item B<--no-kill> or B<--nokill> or B<-K>

Undo the effect of B<--kill>, B<--kill-or-resquash>, and of the B<KILL> key.

If used with B<set>, set the B<KILL> state in F</run/squashmount> to B<0>,
so that this happens for all subsequent umounts/remounts.

If used with B<status> or B<print*> act as if mount-point was correspondingly
configured (without actually changing the configuration, of course).

=item B<--backup=>I<file/app> or B<-b> I<file/app>

Override the value of B<BACKUP> for all specified mount-points.
If nonempty and not an absolute path, the effective value is the current value
of B<FILE> with the string I<app> appended. The empty value means no backup.
For obvious reasons you should better not give an absolute path if
using several mount-points.

If used with B<set>, set the state in F</run/squashmount>
so that this happens for all subsequent umounts/remounts.

If used with B<status> or B<print*> act as if mount-point was correspondingly
configured (without actually changing the configuration, of course).

=item B<--no-backup> B<--nobackup> or B<-B>

This is equivalent to specifying B<--backup> with an empty argument:
For all specified mount-point no backup is made.

If used with B<set>, set the state in F</run/squashmount>
so that this happens for all subsequent umounts/remounts.

If used with B<status> or B<print*> act as if mount-point was correspondingly
configured (without actually changing the configuration, of course).

=item B<--tempdir=>I<tempdir> or B<-D> I<tempdir>

Override the value of B<TEMPDIR> for all specified mount-points.

If used with B<set>, set the state in F</run/squashmount>
so that this happens for all subsequent umounts/remounts.

If used with B<status> or B<print*> act as if mount-point was correspondingly
configured (without actually changing the configuration, of course).

=item B<--compression=>I<mode>, B<--comp=>I<mode>, or B<-x> I<mode>

Override the value of B<COMPRESSION> for all specified mount-points.

If used with B<set>, set the state in F</run/squashmount>
so that this happens for all subsequent umounts/remounts.

If used with B<status> or B<print*> act as if mount-point was correspondingly
configured (without actually changing the configuration, of course).

=item B<--reset> or B<-r>

After umounting, reset the data changed with the B<set> command according
to the current configuration in F</etc/squashmount.pl>

=item B<--force> or B<-f>

If used with B<remount> do not skip remounting, even if it is not
necessary to resquash or to delete data.

If used with B<create>, continue even if the squash-file already exists.

If used with B<check>, force temporary umounting.

If used with B<stop> or B<restart>, forget information also for
umounted mount-points.

If used with B<forget>, forget information also if mount-point is mounted.
The latter is very dangerous, see the description of the B<forget> command.

If used with B<print-...> or B<status>, when required to print directories
corresponding to temporary names not created yet, they will be created and
their names fixed for future mounting (until B<forgot> is used).

=item B<--ignore-state> or B<-I>

Whenever umounting, try to umount even mount-points which are apparently
umounted according to the setting in F</run/squashmount>.
If combined with B<-f> also try to umount B<READONLY> even if
umounting of B<DIR> failed.

Similarly, whenever mounting, try to mount even if apparently already
mounted according to the setting in F</run/squashmount>.
If combined with B<-f> proceed even if mounting of B<READONLY> seems to fail.

This option should only be necessary in exceptional cases like bugs in
B<squashmount> or F</etc/squashmount.pl> or if you manually interfered
or removed or corrupted F</run/squashmount>.
In this case, the best attempt is to call
C<squashmount -fI umount> or C<squashmount -nfI umount> for trying to force
umounting unconditionally all configured directories.

=item B<--lazy=>I<value> or B<-L> I<value>

B<value> must be one of the following:

=over 16

=item B<0> (or the empty string)

Fail if umounting fails.

=item B<1> (default unless configured in F</etc/squashmount.pl>)

If umounting fails, retry B<umount --lazy>.

=item B<-1>

Try only B<umount --lazy>. Note that lazy umounting can be dangerous.
Use B<-1> only if you know what you are doing.

=back

=item B<--lsof=>I<value> or B<-l> I<value>

B<value> must be one of the following:

=over 16

=item (the empty string)

Never execute B<lsof>.

=item B<0>

If B<lsof> indicates that umounting would fail, act as if B<$lazy=1>.

=item B<1> (default if B<$lsof> is unchanged in F</etc/squashmount.pl>)

Fail if B<lsof> indicates that umounting would fail.

=item B<-1>

If B<lsof> indicates that umounting would fail, act as if B<$lazy=-1>.
Use B<-1> only if you know what you are doing!

=back

=item B<--lsof-ro=>I<value>

As B<--lsof>, but for the B<READONLY> directory.

=item B<--ll>

Prefer C<squashfuse_ll> over C<squashfuse> if available.
This is the default unless B<$squashfuse_ll> is set to a false value in the
configuration file F</etc/squashmount.pl>.

=item B<--no-ll> or B<--noll>

Do not use C<squashfuse_ll>.
This option overrides the setting of B<$squashfuse_ll> in the
configuration file F</etc/squashmount.pl>

=item B<--allow>

Use the option C<-o allow_other> for B<MOUNT_UNIONFS_FUSE>,
B<MOUNT_FUNIONFS>, and B<MOUNT_SQUASHFUSE> as default if these variables
are not specified.
This is the default unless B<--user> is in use.

=item B<--no-allow> or B<--noallow>

Do not use the option C<-o allow_other> for B<MOUNT_UNIONFS_FUSE>,
B<MOUNT_FUNIONFS>, and B<MOUNT_SQUASHFUSE> as default if these variables
are not specified.
This overrides the setting of B<--user>.

=item B<--locking>

Use perl's flock() to avoid simultaneous usage of the same mount-point.

=item B<--no-locking> or B<--nolocking>

This is the opposite of B<--locking>.
Whether B<--locking> or B<--no-locking> is the default depends on the
variable B<$locking> in F</etc/squashmount.pl> (the default in the latter
is true except if it is clear that no writing will be required).

=item B<--threshold=>I<size> or B<-t> I<size>

This is analogous to B<--no-squash> but will avoid the resquashing only if
there is less that I<size> bytes changed on disk.
(You can append B<k> or B<m> to I<size> to denote multiples of 1024 or 1024^2,
respectively.)
A negative number is equivalent to B<--no-squash>.
If I<size> is empty the value configured from F</etc/squashmount.pl> is taken.

=item B<--processors=>I<num> or B<-p> I<num>

Call B<mksquashfs> with the option B<-processors> I<num>.
If I<num> is empty or consists only of spaces, the option is not passed,
meaning that all available processors are used.

=item B<--mem=>I<bytes> or B<-m> I<bytes>

Call B<mksquashfs> with the option B<-mem> I<bytes>.
If I<bytes> is empty or consists only of spaces, the option is not passed.
In this case, the size depends on the B<mksquashfs> version;
some versions of B<mksquashfs> use in this case B<1954M>

=item B<--separator=>I<sep> or B<-S> I<sep>

When using B<check> or B<print-...> with option B<-q>,
I<sep> is appended to the output of each mount-point.
The default is a newline.

=item B<--pass-dir>

When this option is used, the passed arguments I<mask1> I<mask2> ... are
interpreted as names of mounted readonly or writable directories.
This is to allow this script to be used as a callback from umount-wrappers
like /sbin/umount.overlayfs or /sbin/umount.squashfs

=item B<--color> or B<-F>

Try to color even if output is not a terminal.

=item B<--no-color> or B<--nocolor> or B<-C>

Do not color the output.
Setting the environment variable B<ANSI_COLORS_DISABLED> has the same effect.

=item B<--no-star> or B<--nostar>

Omit printing C< * > at beginning of messages.

=item B<--star>

Print C< * > at beginning of messages.
This is currently the default, but this might change in future versions
of squashmount, at least for certain commands.

=item B<--title=>I<options> or B<-T> I<options>

The corresponding I<options> are passed to the title script to set the
hardstatus title. This option can be used accumulatively.
If at least one passed option is B<->, the title script is not used.

=item B<--error> or B<-e>

Do not process further mount-points when an error occurs.

=item B<--no-error> or B<--noerror> or B<-E>

Do not break on non-fatal errors but try to process all (matching) mount-points
if there is a chance to do so. This is the default.

=item B<--fatal>

Return nonzero exit status only on fatal errors.
In particular, the status will be zero even if the (u)mounting of some
mount-points failed.

This is the default with the commands B<start>, B<stop>, or B<restart>, because
this is probably  the appropriate behavior if called from an init-system.
For all other commands the default is:

=item B<--no-fatal> or  B<--nofatal>

Return nonzero exit status if the handling of at least one mount-point
produced an error.
This is the default except for the commands B<start>, B<stop>, or B<restart>,
see above

=item B<--first> or B<-1>

Only execute the first match, then end.

=item B<--arg=>I<argument> or B<-a> I<argument> (accumulative)

Add I<argument> to B<@ARGV> for the configuration file,
see the section B<ADVANCED CONFIGURATION>.

=item B<-->

Last option

=back

=head1 F</etc/squashmount.pl>

The file F</etc/squashmount.pl> can be any perl code which fills
the array B<@mounts> with references to hashes; one hash for every tag.
In addition, the arrays B<@order> and B<@squashorder> can be filled with
the available tools, the order in which they should be tried,
and flags whether modprobe should be called, how to test the existence of
tools and what to do if tools appear unavailable.
Also the default variables B<$lazy>, B<$lsof>, B<$lsof_ro>, B<$squashfuse_ll>,
B<$locking>, B<$modprobe_loop>, B<$obsolete_overlayfs>,
B<$resquash_on_start> can be initialized:
They are initialized to B<1> (perl interprets this as I<true>)
or B<''> (I<false>).
The arrays B<@umount>, B<@umount_ro>, B<@fumount>, B<@fumount_ro>
can carry default values for B<UMOUNT>, B<UMOUNT_RO>, B<FUMOUNT>, and
B<FUMOUNT_RO>, respectively.
The variable B<$rm_rundir> can be set to determine whether (and how)
the directory B</run/squashmount> should be removed.
Similarly, also the variables B<$rm_dir>, B<$rm_change>, B<$rm_workdir>,
B<$rm_readonly> can be set to determine default values for
B<RM_DIR>, B<RM_CHANGE>, B<RM_WORKDIR>, and B<RM_READONLY>.
Finally, also the variables B<$mksquash_verbose>,
B<$processors>, B<$mem> can specify the default values
if the corresponding options are not passed.

For advanced configuration, you can access the variables B<@ARGV>, B<$command>,
B<$storing>, and you can set callback functions/function arrays B<$before>,
B<$after>, B<$before_mount>, B<$after_mount>, B<$before_umount>, B<$after_umount>
which are explained in the section B<ADVANCED CONFIGURATION>.
There also some auxiliary perl functions available which are explained later on.

Here is an example for this file.
(You can use this syntax if you do not have much knowledge about perl;
if you know more about perl, a more convenient syntax is recommended,
see the remarks at the end of this manpage.)

Except for B<@mounts>, the meaning of the variables is easily explained:

=over 8

=item B<$lazy>

This determines the default I<value> of B<--lazy>.
This variable defaults to the value B<1> (I<true>).

=item B<$lsof>

This determines the default I<value> of B<--lsof>.
This variable defaults to the value B<1>.

=item B<$lsof_ro>

This determines the default I<value> of B<--lsof_ro>.
This variable defaults to the value B<0>.

=item B<$squashfuse_ll>

This determines whether B<--ll> or B<--no-ll> is the default.
This variable defaults to the value B<1> (I<true>), meaning that B<--ll>
is the default unless overridden in F</etc/squashmount.pl>.

=item B<$killpower>

This is a string or a reference to an array of strings.
If one of the strings is an existing file, then B<squashmount> behaves as
if option B<--no-squash> has been passed.
The default value is the array reference
B<[ '/etc/killpower', '/etc/nut/killpower', '/etc/killpower' ]>.
The explanation for this default follows.

The file F</etc/killpower> or F</etc/nut/killpower> is generated by
tools like B<nut> when an emergency shutdown is needed.
Consequently, by default, B<squashmount> will not try to resquash any data
when it is on an emergency shutdown caused by such a tool.

The file F</etc/nosquash> may be generated by you if you know that
you will reboot often (e.g. to test new kernels) and if you do not want to
resquash the data just for rebooting.
Note that for a single reboot, it is more convenient to call
B<squashmount -n set> instead, but this effect is gone after the reboot:
when one makes changes to the system which require a series of reboots
(e.g. tracking a bug in the kernel), it is easy to forget to call
this command before every single rebooting which can be quite annoying.
Therefore the file F</etc/nosquash> can be generated to keep this information
across reboots; of course, one should not forget to remove this file once
the series of reboots is finished.

=item B<$locking>

This determines whether B<--locking> or B<--no-locking> is the default.
This variable defaults to the value B<''> (I<false>) when query commands
like B<status> or B<print-*> are used; for all other commands it defaults to
B<1> (I<true>).

=item B<$obsolete_overlayfs>

This variable is only important when squashmount attempts to mount B<overlayfs>
(in contrast to B<overlay> which is contained in >=kernel-3.18)

When this perl variable is B<''> (I<false>), which is the default,
then it is attempted to mount overlayfs with the B<workdir> option
(required since overlayfs-22, i.e., since linux kernel-3.15),
and only if this fails, it is attempted to mount overlayfs without this option.
Undefine this variable if you do not want the latter.
In contrast, set this variable to B<1> (I<true>) if you have an obsolete
version of overlayfs (linux kernel less than 3.15): In this case, it is
first attempted to mount overlayfs without the B<workdir> option,
and the B<workdir> option is only attempted as a fallback if the former fails.

If you never want to use overlayfs with >=kernel-3.15 (and <kernel-3.18)
set B<$obsolete_overlayfs = 'force'>.

Not setting B<$obsolete_overlayfs> correctly should not cause any problems,
but it might lead to undesired warning/kernel messages and can cost some time.

=item B<$modprobe_loop>

This determines whether C<modprobe loop> is implied by modprobing for squashfs.
This variable defaults to the value B<1> (I<true>).

=item B<$resquash_on_start>

If this variable is B<1> (true), this becomes the default for
B<RESQUASH_ON_START> for all mount-points for which B<RESQUASH_ON_START>
is not explicitly set differently. It defaults to B<''> (I<false>).

=item B<$rm_rundir>

If this variable is a nonzero integer number then at B<squashmount stop>
the directory F</run/squashmount> is removed if it is empty.
If the number is bigger than 1, also the corresponding number of parent
directories (minus one) are removed (if nonempty). If the number is negative,
all parent directories are removed (if nonempty).
The default of this variable is B<1>.

=item B<$rm_dir>

=item B<$rm_changes>

=item B<$rm_workdir>

=item B<$rm_readonly>

These variables are taken as the defaults for B<RM_DIR>, B<RM_CHANGES>,
B<RM_WORKDIR>, or B<RM_READONLY>, respectively, if the latter variables
are not defined for a mount-point. The default of B<$rm_dir> is B<0>,
the default of the other three variables is B<1>.

=item B<$mksquash_verbose>

This is the default string if B<--squash-verbose> is not specified.
This variable defaults to B<q?n-n+!>
(if not overridden in B</etc/squashmount.pl>)

=item B<$processors>

This is the default string if B<--processors> is not specified.
If not set, the default is the empty string.

=item B<$mem>

This is the default string if B<--mem> is not specified.
If not set, the default is the empty string.

=item B<@umount>

This array determines the default for the values B<UMOUNT> if the
latter is not defined. Note that the default for B<@umount> in turn
is defined by the option B<--umount>.
In particular, if you set B<@umount> to a fixed value like C<@umount = ('-i');>,
the option B<--umount> will have no effect. You can use perl-code to combine
the option. For instance, when you use instead C<push(@umount, '-i');>,
the option B<-i> will be added to the options specified by B<--umount>.
Similarly, you can make a case distinction like
C<@umount = ('-i') unless(@umount);> in which case the option B<-i> will be
only used if no option was specified with B<--umount>.

=item B<@umount_ro>

This array determines the default for the values B<UMOUNT_RO> if the
latter is not defined. Note that the default for B<@umount_ro> in turn
is defined by the option B<--umount-ro>.
See the description of B<@umount> on the consequences of this.

=item B<@fumount>

This array determines the default for the values B<FUMOUNT> if the
latter is not defined.

=item B<@fumount_ro>

This array determines the default for the values B<FUMOUNT_RO> if the
latter is not defined.

=item B<@order>

This array determines in which order the overlay/aufs/... tools are tried
and/or whether it is attempted to modprobe them and on which conditions they
are (tacitly) skipped.

The first successful tool is chosen, and if all fail, B<mount --bind> is used.
The content of this array should be strings with one of the texts

=over 16

=item B<overlay>, B<overlayfs>, B<aufs>, B<unionfs-fuse>, B<unionfs>, B<funionfs>, B<bind>

=back

for the corresponding tool. (Note that B<overlayfs> refers only to overlayfs
up to version 22 (available as a patch for <=linux-3.17); for >=linux-3.18
the corresponding filesystem is called B<overlay> in B<squashmount>.)

By default, it is attempted to B<modprobe> the corresponding module,
and if that B<modprobe> fails, the corresponding tool is tacitly skipped,
passing to the next tool in the list until the first succeeds.

If none succeeds, the fallback B<bind> is used (with an error message).
If B<bind> occurs explicitly in the list, no error message is emitted.

Optionally, you can append or prepend the following special flags to change
the default behavior with B<modprobe>.

=over 16

=item B<!> or B<!!>

If this flag is used, a failure in the modprobe command is ignored;
in case of B<!!> the modprobe is not even attempted.
In particular you should use this if it might happen (or you know) that the
corresponding tool is compiled directly into the kernel.
Note that B<overlayfs>, B<aufs>, B<unionfs> have their own kernel modules
while B<unionfs-fuse> and B<funionfs> both require the B<fuse> module and
need special user space binaries.

=item B<?> or B<??>

If this flag is used and the B<modprobe> failed (or if combined with B<!!>)
the content of B</sys/modules> (or if that fails B</proc/config.gz>)
is checked for whether the corresponding tool appears available
in the running linux kernel.
If the tool appears unavailable it is tacitly skipped.
For the case that B</sys/modules> cannot be read and
B</proc/config.gz> cannot be read (the latter including the case
that the perl module B<IO::Uncompress::Gunzip> is unavailable) and the
B<??> variant is used, the tool is considered as unavailable.

=item B<#>

If this flag is used, it is checked whether the binary
(B<mount> in case of B<overlay>, B<overlayfs>, B<aufs>, or B<unionfs>
or the special user space binary for B<unionfs-fuse> or B<funionfs>,
respectively) is available in your path. If it is unavailable, the tool is
tacitly skipped. This flag is ignored if neither B<File::Which> nor the
B<which> program are available.

=back

If B<squashmount> is used with a command for which the order is possibly needed
(B<start>, B<restart>, B<mount>, B<remount>), this array defaults to

=over 16

=item qw(overlay!? overlayfs!? aufs! unionfs-fuse! unionfs! funionfs!)

=back

This default means that all modules are loaded as required, with overlay and
overlayfs being tacitly skipped if the running kernel does not provide support
for it; all other tools are attempted in the order until the first succeeds,
no matter whether the kernel provides support for it.

If B<squashmount> is used with a different command, the default of this
array is empty.

=item B<@squashorder>

This array is rather analogous to B<@order> with the difference that it
determines the tool for mounting squash files.
The available tools are

=over 16

=item B<squashfs>, B<squashfuse>

=back

The same flags are available as for B<@order>. The default value is

=over 16

=item qw(squashfs!? squashfuse!)

=back

=back

The array B<@mounts> defines the various mount-points.
The first mount-point in the above example is the minimal data which
has to be specified for a mount-point.
However, typically you should also specify at least the keys B<CHANGES>,
B<WORKDIR> and usually also B<READONLY> unless you have a special reason not to.
The following keys are supported. If a key is undefined or not explicitly set,
a default value is chosen in some cases.

=over 8

=item B<TAG>

A unique identifier:
The B<TAG> is matched against the I<mask> entries on the command line.
The content must be alphanumeric; only the symbols B<.> B<-> B<_> are allowed.

=item B<DIR>

The absolute path of the main directory which you want to squash.

Alternatively, B<DIR> can be a function reference which returns a string to
the directory or alternatively a B<File::Temp::Dir> object.
This function is executed only once if B<DIR> is unknown and in this case
it gets passed the tag as an argument.
The intention is that this function can be used to return e.g. a temporary
dir name by using something like as in the B<fancy_temporary> example above.

Be aware that if this function uses B<File::Temp::newdir>, it should pass
B<CLEANUP =E<gt> ''> to avoid that the directory is magically removed recursively:
Forgetting this can severely damage your data!

As an exception, if the function returns the corresponding created object
(and not only a filename as in the B<make_temporary_subdir> example above),
B<squashmount> will care about disabling B<CLEANUP> automatically.
For this reason, we had lazily avoided B<CLEANUP =E<gt> ''> in some places
in the above B<fancy_temporary> example when calling B<File::Temp::newdir>.

If you use a temporary directory, you can find the actual used path with
B<squashmount print-dir ...>

=item B<FILE>

The absolute path to the squash-file which contains the actual data.

=item B<CHANGES>

The directory into which the changes to B<DIR> are stored.
If B<CHANGES> is not specified then a temporary directory is created
and used instead.

The same rules as for B<DIR> hold, that is, you can also pass a function which
explicitly calls B<File::Temp::newdir> with appropriate data.

Note that using a temporary directory may be dangerous since if temporary
directories are cleaned on boot this means that modifications to B<DIR>
are lost if they are not (successfully) squashed on shutdown
(e.g. due to option B<--no-squash>).
If you use a temporary directory, you can find the actual path with
B<squashmount print-changes ...>

=item B<WORKDIR>

The working directory required by overlay and overlayfs,
set according to the same rules as for B<CHANGES>.
If you want to use current versions of overlay or overlayfs
(kernel 3.15 or newer) this B<must> be on the same filesystem as B<CHANGES>.
If you do not want to use B<WORKDIR>, set B<$obsolete_overlayfs = 'force'>
and use only overlayfs (not overlay).

=item B<READONLY>

If this is nonempty but not an absolute path, then B<DIR> is mounted readonly.
If this is an absolute path then a readonly version of the content of B<DIR>
is mounted here.
It is not possible to omit this directory if B<DIR> should be writable.
For the special case that B<READONLY> is empty, a temporary directly is used.

The same rules as for B<DIR> hold, that is, you can also pass a function which
explicitly calls File::Temp::newdir with appropriate data.

If you use a temporary directory, you can find the actual path with
B<squashmount print-readonly ...>

=item B<THRESHOLD>

This is the threshold value used for that mount-point
(unless changed by command line options).
Set it to B<-1> for an infinite threshold,
that is, to get the effect of B<--no-squash>.
Set it to B<-2> to force squashing even if there were no changes,
that is, to get the effect of B<--force-squash>.
The default is B<0>.

=item B<KILL>

If this is a positive number, B<--kill> is active for that mount-point.
If this is a negative number, B<--kill-or-resquash> is active for that
mount-point, that is, changes are killed unless they reach B<THRESHOLD>
(in the latter case, they are resquashed, as usual).
The value can be overridden by the corresponding command line options.

For backward compatibility, if B<KILL> is a nonempty string, it is treated
as a positive number.

=item B<RESQUASH_ON_START>

If this value is undefined, the value of the variable B<$resquash_on_start>
is considered instead; however, if it is defined, its value overrides the
global setting of B<$resquash_on_start>,

If the effective value is true (nonempty and not 0), then B<squashmount start>
attempts to resquash the data, and sets the B<-n> option for the mount-point
so that (by default) there is no resquashing of the data when
B<squashmount umount> or B<squashmount stop> is called (unless an option like
B<-s> is used later to override the previous B<-n>).

Thus, while the "default" operation of B<squashmount> is to resquash the
data on umounting (that is, as a rule, when you shut down the machine),
setting this variable (or B<$resquash_on_start>) causes "normally" the
resquashing to be postponed until the next start of the machine.

Of course, this makes only sense if your B<CHANGES> directory is not a
temporary directory which is cleaned during restarting: This is the reason
why you can set this variable individually for each mount-point.
Unless you have such exceptional mount-points, it is usually more convenient
to set the global default through B<$resquash_on_start>.

=item B<RM_DIR>

=item B<RM_CHANGES>

=item B<RM_WORKDIR>

=item B<RM_READONLY>

If this value is undefined, the value of the variable
B<$rm_dir>, B<$rm_changes>, B<$rm_workdir>, or B<$rm_readonly> is used
instead, respectively.

If the effective value is a nonzero number then with B<squashmount stop>
the corresponding directory is removed if it is empty.
If the number is bigger than 1, also the corresponding number of parent
directories (minus one) is removed (if nonempty). If the number is negative,
all parent directories are removed (if nonempty).

=item B<MKSQUASHFS>

This should be a (possibly empty) string or a reference to an array of strings:
These strings are used as additional options when calling B<mksquashfs>.
The option B<-noappend> is used automatically.
Depending on B<$squashfs_verbose>, B<COMPRESSION>, B<DEFAULT_FRAGMENTS>
also the options B<-no-progress>, B<-comp>, or B<-always-use-fragments>
are appended automatically.

=item B<MKSQUASHFS>, B<COMPOPT_{XZ,LZMA,GZIP,LZO,LZ4,}>

These should be a (possibly empty) strings or references arrays of strings:
These strings are used as additional options when calling B<mksquashfs>
(the latter only if the corresponding B<COMPRESSION> option is used;
B<COMPOPT_> is used if B<COMPRESSION> is empty).
The option B<-noappend> is used automatically.
Depending on B<$squashfs_verbose>, B<COMPRESSION>, B<DEFAULT_FRAGMENTS>
also the options B<-no-progress>, B<-comp>, or B<-always-use-fragments>
are appended automatically.
If the corresponding variable is not defined, it is assumed to be empty
with the following exception:

=over 16

=item B<COMPOPT_LZ4>: If undefined, defaults to C<'-Xhc'>.
Set it to the empty string if you want fastest B<lz4> compression instead.

=back

=item B<MOUNT_OVERLAY>

This should be a (possibly empty) string or a reference to an array of strings:
These strings are used as additional options when mounting with overlay.
(Note that overlayfs is available only for >=kernel-3.18;
see B<MOUNT_OVERLAYFS> for older versions).
The default is B<['-o', 'noatime']>.

=item B<MOUNT_OVERLAYFS>

This should be a (possibly empty) string or a reference to an array of strings:
These strings are used as additional options when mounting with overlayfs.
(Note that overlayfs is available only for <kernel-3.18;
see B<MOUNT_OVERLAY> for newer versions).
The default is B<['-o', 'noatime']>.

=item B<MOUNT_AUFS>

This should be a (possibly empty) string or a reference to an array of strings:
These strings are used as additional options when mounting with aufs.
The default is B<['-o', 'noatime']>.

=item B<MOUNT_UNIONFS_FUSE>

This should be a (possibly empty) string or a reference to an array of strings:
These strings are used as additional options when mounting with unionfs-fuse.
The default is B<['-o', 'cow', '-o', 'allow_other', '-o', 'use_ino',
'-o', 'nonempty', '-o', 'noatime', '-o', 'hide_meta_files']>.

=item B<MOUNT_UNIONFS>

This should be a (possibly empty) string or a reference to an array of strings:
These strings are used as additional options when mounting with unionfs.
The default is B<['-o', 'noatime']>.

=item B<MOUNT_FUNIONFS>

This should be a (possibly empty) string or a reference to an array of strings:
These strings are used as additional options when mounting with funionfs.
The default is B<['-o', 'allow_other', '-o', 'nonempty']>.

=item B<MOUNT_SQUASHFUSE>

This should be a (possibly empty) string or a reference to an array of strings:
These strings are used as additional options when mounting with squashfuse.
The default is B<['-o', 'allow_other', '-o', 'nonempty']>.

=item B<UMOUNT>

This should be a (possibly empty) string or a reference to an array of strings:
These strings are used as additional options when umounting B<DIR>
(see also B<UMOUNT_RO>).
If nothing is specified, the value of B<@umount> is used whose default in
turn is set by the option B<--umount>.
Note that if this value is specified, the values of B<@umount> (and thus
the option B<--umount>) is completely ignored. You can use perl-code if you
do not want this. For instance, C<UMOUNT => [ @umount, '-r' ]> will add
the option B<-r> to that specified through B<@umount>. Similarly,
C<UMOUNT => ((@umount) ? '-r' : undef)> will use the option B<-r> if
nothing was specified in B<@umount> (or through the option B<--umount>),
otherwise, it will use the default (i.e. the value of B<@umount>).

=item B<FUMOUNT>

This is analogous to B<UMOUNT>, but when B<fusermount -u> is used.

=item B<UMOUNT_RO>

This should be a (possibly empty) string or a reference to an array of strings:
These strings are used as additional options when umounting a readonly
directory. If nothing is specified, the value of B<@umount_ro> is used whose
default in turn is set by the option B<--umount_ro>.
See the description of B<UMOUNT> on the consequences of this.

=item B<FUMOUNT_RO>

This is analogous to B<UMOUNT_RO>, but when B<fusermount -u> is used.

=item B<COMPRESSION>

Specifies the compression mode for B<mksquashfs>:
The available values depend on the installed version of B<mksquashfs>;
typically B<xz>, B<lzma>, B<gzip>, B<lzo>, B<lz4> are available
(ordered in increasing compression ratio, i.e. B<xz> is usually the slowest but
best in compression ration while B<lz4> is the quickest).
If the value is empty, no B<-comp> parameter is passed,
that is, the default of the installed B<mksquashfs> is chosen
(which is usually B<gzip> but might depend on your version of B<mksquashfs>).
The default of B<COMPRESSION> (that is, if undefined or not explicitly set)
is B<lz4>; note that in earlier versions of B<squashmount> this was B<xz>.
Note also that B<lz4> support in squashfs requires linux-3.19 or newer.

=item B<DEFAULT_FRAGMENTS>

Unless this variable is a nonempty string,
B<-always-use-fragments> is appended to the options of B<mksquashfs>
which usually improves the compression ratio.
You might need to set this variable (at the cost of slightly worse results)
if you need compatibility with older versions of B<squashfs>.

=item B<BACKUP>

If this is set to an absolute path, then when resquashing B<FILE>,
a copy of the old version is moved to that path.
If the file B<BACKUP> already exists, it is removed.

If B<BACKUP> is not an absolute path but nonempty, the path is that of
B<FILE> with the value of B<BACKUP> appended.
If B<BACKUP> is empty, no backup is made.

=item B<CHMOD>

If defined and nonempty this should be a number (if you want an octal number,
do not enclose into quotes and start with a leading B<0>, or otherwise
use perl's B<oct(>I<decimal number>B<)> function).
The number defines the mode to which the squash-file is changed with B<chmod>
whenever it is created.
The empty string means that the mode remains B<0400>.
If undefined (the default), the mode B<0644> is taken.

=item B<CHOWN>

If defined and nonempty this should be either an array reference B<[> I<uid>B<,> I<gid> B<]>
or a string of the form I<uid>B<:>I<gid>; in this case, the user/group id of
the file is changed to I<uid>/I<gid>, respectively.
Use the undefined or empty value or B<-1> to indicate that I<uid>/I<gid>
should not be changed (typically remains B<0>).
If you want to pass the user or group name (instead of the user or group id),
you can use e.g. the perl construct B<(getpwnam('>I<username>B<'))[2]> or
B<(getgrnam('>I<groupname>B<'))[2]>, respectively.

=item B<CHMOD_DIR>

If this is defined and a number (see B<CHMOD> for octal numbers),
then it is attempted to change the mode of B<DIR> to this number
after successfully mounting B<DIR>.

=item B<CHOWN_DIR>

If defined and nonempty this should be in the same format as in B<CHOWN>.
In this case, B<DIR> is changed to the corresponding user/group after
successfully mounting. Note that this usually implicitly changes the
permissions of B<CHANGES> as well, but this can depend on the tool which
is used to merge the directories.

=item B<TEMPDIR>

The new version of the squashed data is first created in a temporary file.
If B<TEMPDIR> is set it is created in this directory.
It is useful to choose a directory on a harddisk if the regular temporary
directory is a ramdisk with less space than the expected filesize.
If you choose a harddisk, things will be faster if you choose the same
partition on which the squash-file B<FILE> resides.

=item B<BLOCKSIZE>

The size of one disk-block when calculating the changed data for the threshold.
The default is 4096.
The blocksize does not have to be in relation with the physical blocksize.
For instance, if you a directory with small files, it might be a good idea
to set B<BLOCKSIZE> to a huge value so that the calculation for the
threshold is essentially based on the number of files (instead of their size).

=item B<SKIP>

This is a regular expression (or a string which will be interpreted as
a regular expression in multiline mode), or a reference to an array of
regular expressions/strings.
If you use braces () in a regular expression, it is recommended to use
the C<n> flag to speed up the processing, e.g. C<qr{root/(foo|bar)}n>.

For each file/directory in B<CHANGES> (except F<.> and F<..> directories)
its path (relative to B<CHANGES>) is matched against these regular expressions.
If the file matches, it is not considered as being changed.
This is useful to avoid squashing only because e.g. a known temporary
file has changed in this directory which you do not care about.

When all changes are skipped during umounting, the B<CHANGES> directory
is cleaned anyway, i.e. skipping a file means that changes to
this file are usually lost (unless the directory is resquashed anyway).

If a file you want to skip resides in a subdirectory (not in the root
of B<CHANGES>) you probably also want to skip all parent directories,
because overlay/overlayfs/aufs/... has to create them to create the file.
However, to be more careful you might want skip them with B<DIFF>
(as that will check that it is really a directory and exists in B<READONLY>).

=item B<SKIPDIR>

This is similar to B<SKIP>, but only for directories; moreover, also the
whole content of matching directories is being considered as unchanged.

If you want to B<SKIPDIR> a directory lying not in the root of B<CHANGES>,
you will probably want to include its parent directories to B<DIFF>
(or to B<SKIP> if you are less careful).

=item B<DIFF>

This is similar to B<SKIP>, but a little bit more careful:
The file/directory is only considered unchanged if it is the same as the
corresponding file in the B<READONLY> directory, up to possibly
permissions or time stamps.
This is to avoid resquashing just because some timestamps or permissions
were changed.

As for B<SKIP> and B<SKIPDIR>, for files in subdirectories you will probably
also want to include the parent directories here.
As an example, to ignore changes only in timestamps or permissions of
the files

=over 16

=item F<tex/generic/config/language.dat>

=item F<tex/generic/config/language.dat.lua>

=item F<tex/generic/config/language.def>

=back

you must also ignore that the corresponding parents are created in B<CHANGES>.
Therefore, in the example file above (in TAG tex), the regular expression
in B<DIFF> not only matches the above files but also their parent directories.

To match for files, it might be convenient to use several regular expressions
(or strings): All related variables B<SKIP>, B<SKIPDIR>, B<DIFF> accept also
references to arrays of regular expressions. See e.g. B<SKIPDIR> in
in the fancy_temporary example above.
Note in that example also that you can can pass regular expressions
instead of strings. This way you can pass e.g. perl flags to ignore case.

=item B<SKIPFUNC>

This is the most generic form of B<SKIP>, B<SKIPDIR>, B<DIFF>:
This is a reference to a function which can decide whether the file is being
considered as changed.
The function gets passed three parameters: The relative filename,
the absolute filename, and the corresponding pathname in the READONLY directory.
The function must return a true value (e.g. 1) if the file should not be
considered as changed.
If the function sets B<$File::Find::prune = 1> in case of a directory
then its content is not considered as changed, either.

In the above B<fancy_temporary> example, this functions is used to ignore all
added/modified (empty) directories.

=item B<FILL>

This is similar to B<SKIP>, but with the opposite meaning:
If there is a matching file/directory then any positive value of
B<THRESHOLD> is considered as reached by the corresponding data.
If B<SKIP>, B<SKIPDIR>, B<DIFF>, or B<SKIPFUNC> apply also, these
take precedence over B<FILL> or B<FILLFUNC>.

=item B<FILLFUNC>

This is the analogue of B<SKIPFUNC>, but corresponding to B<FILL> instead of B<SKIP>.
If the function returns a true value (e.g. 1) the threshold is considered as filled.
This function has no need to modify B<$File::Find::prune>.

=back

It is intentional that F</etc/squashmount.pl> is ordinary perl code so that
you can use all sort of perl features if you like.

Here are some examples why this might be useful:

=over 8

=item B<(1)> You can source other config files/directories at your discretion.

=item B<(2)> You can even interpret other config files in a format you prefer.

=item B<(3)> You can make setups based on the existence of symlinks or dirs.

=item B<(4)> You can use more complex code to setup B<@order>.

=item B<(5)> You can use various shortcuts to setup "standard" mount-points.

=item B<(6)> You can define some keys as "defaults" for all mount-points.

=back

In any case, it is recommended to not use B<too> much code since the code
will be parsed/executed with every call of B<squashmount>.
In particular, if you want some more complex code to setup B<@order> according
to you system, it is recommended to enclose this code into C<if(@order)> so
that this code is only executed if the value of B<@order> is really needed.
(Recall that the default of B<@order> is nonempty only if B<squashmount> is
used with a command for which it might be necessary to know its value.)

To use some of the mentioned features you need some perl knowledge, of course.
However, others are easy to use even without deep perl knowledge.
In particular, concerning B<(5)> and B<(6)>, B<squashmount> provides two
functions which make this task relatively easy:

=over 8

=item B<standard_mount(>I<tag>B<,> I<dir>, ...B<)>

This function returns a reference to a hash with the keys B<TAG> and B<DIR>
filled according to the first two arguments.
In addition, the values for the keys B<CHANGES>, B<WORKDIR>, B<READONLY>,
and B<FILE> are generated by just appending B<.mount/changes>,
B<.mount/workdir>, B<.mount/readonly>, B<.mount/>I<dirname>B<.sfs>.
Moreover, if I<...> are references to hashes, they are added to the hash:
Later hashes override earlier ones; setting a value to C<undef> in a sense
cancels a previous definition.

=item B<added_hash(>I<hashref>B<,> ...B<)>

This function returns a reference to a hash which merges all hashes,
that is, it is like B<standard_mount()> except that it does
not fill a hash with certain values first.
The idea is that this function can be used to start with a "default" hash
and override/modify/add some data at your discretion.

For perl specialists: This function is practically the same as that provided
by B<Hash::Merge::Simple>, but it does not require the existence of that
perl module, and it does not work recursively.

=back

Here is an example how to use this to specify the portage mount-point from
the above example and additionally a "standard" mount-point (analogously
to the portage mount-point but with different paths and without the
B<THRESHOLD> option) in a shorter way:

=over 8

=item push(@mounts,

=over 16

=item standard_mount('portage, '/usr/portage', {

=over 24

=item THRESHOLD => '40m'

=back

=item }),

=item standard_mount('kernel', '/usr/src')

=back

=item );

=back

It is recommended to use a perl variable like B<$defaults> to contain
a reference to a hash with data which you want to specify for practically
every mount-point like B<COMPRESSION> or B<TEMPDIR> and to add this
variable to every point-mount.
This way you can easily change the defaults without manipulating every
mount-point entry manually. (You can still override $defaults
for particular mount-points at your discretion.)
Here is such an example which also demonstrates the use of B<added_hash()>:

=over 8

=item my $tempdir = { TEMPDIR => '/my/ramdisk' };

=item my $always = { COMPRESSION => 'gzip', THRESHOLD => '20m' };

=item my $defaults =  added_hash($always, { BACKUP => '.bak' }, $tempdir);

=item push(@mounts,

=over 16

=item standard_mount('portage', '/usr/portage', $defaults),

=item standard_mount('kernel', '/usr/src', $defaults),

=item standard_mount('games', '/usr/share/games', $defaults, {

=over 24

=item READONLY => undef  # cancel standard definition

=back

=item })

=back

=item );

=back

=head1 ADVANCED CONFIGURATION

Since the configuration file consists of perl code, you can do all sort of
conditional configuration in the configuration code.

For instance, you can use the same configuration file for different machines,
making the behavior depend on the hostname. Here is such an example:

=over 8

=item use Sys::Hostname;  # Use a module to fetch the hostname

=item # The environment variable B<HOSTNAME> can override the hostname

=item my $hostname = ($ENV{'HOSTNAME'} // hostname());

=back

=over 8

=item # Here can be configuration common for all hosts...

=back

=over 8


=item if($hostname =~ m{^(foo|bar)$}n) {

=over 16

=item # Configuration for hosts 'foo' and 'bar' only

=back

=item } elsif($hostname eq 'bazola') {

=over 16

=item # Configuration for host 'bazola' only

=back

=item } else {

=over 16

=item # Configuration for all other hosts only

=back

=item }

=back

=over 8

=item # Configuration common for all hosts

=back

In some cases, you might want to make the configuration even dependent on
the command line. For instance, you might want that certain mount-points
are not visible during the "regular" B<squashmount start> but must be activated
explicitly. Or you might want to make a certain path dependent on an option
passed on the command line.

For this reason, it is possible to pass arguments from the command line
to the configuration file with B<-a> I<argument> (or B<--arg=>I<argument>):
Arguments passed this way are collected in the array B<@ARGV> which can be
accessed from within the configuration.

You can use the functions B<info>(), B<warning>(), B<error>(), B<errorinfo>(),
and B<fatal>() to output information to the user: All of these functions
take arbitrary many arguments, each argument is output into a separate line
(somewhat formatted according to the context).
The function B<fatal>() also finishes B<squashmount> with exit status B<1>;
the difference between B<error>() and B<errorinfo>() is that the latter
does not output the text "error".

However, some care has to be taken. For instance, even if you want to hide
certain mount-points from B<squashmount start> (or maybe also from
B<squashmount mount>) for "normal" usage, you will probably not want to
hide that mount-point from B<squashmount stop> (or maybe also not from
B<squashmount umount>), since you probably want that the mount-point is
umounted during shutdown.

For this reason, you can see the currently used command in the perl variable
B<$command>. This variable contains the actual command (even if the user
used a shortcut like B<l> instead of B<list> on the command line);
the command B<list> appears as B<status>.

Special care has to be taken with "variable data" (that is, with data
in mount-points which may differ for different calls of B<squashmount>):
In many occasions, B<squashmount> will store the effective data for later
calls of B<squashmount>, and once this has happened, the stored data usually
overrides the paths from the configuration file.
This is almost always what you want:

Suppose that you have a mount-point with a "variable data" B<DIR>.
If B<DIR> was F</foo/bar> in the moment when B<squash start> is called,
then F</foo/bar> is also used for B<squash umount>, that is, you do not
need to remember that B<DIR> to umount the correct directories.

However, this can also be undesired: Once you umounted this directory,
also the next mount will access the same path, that is, you cannot really
have a "variable" B<DIR> using successively different paths.
A "workaround" for this problem is to use B<squashmount stop>
(or B<squashmount forget>) or to override the corresponding data
in a callback function (see below).

It is explicitly not specified precisely which data is stored, how and when:
This might change in future versions of B<squashmount>,
so do not rely on anything.

The only thing you can rely on in this connection is that data is only stored
if B<$storing> is true: The variable B<$storing> defaults to the same value
as B<$locking>.

It is possible to change the variable B<$storing> in the configuration file.
If you do this, you should probably also change the value of B<$locking>
correspondingly. While it is usually not a problem if you set B<$storing>
and B<$locking> to a true value, you will hardly ever have a reason to set
B<$storing> to a false value. For instance, for B<squashmount mount>,
this would mean that B<squashmount> would not store the information
that the mount-points are now mounted, and so a subsequent
B<squashmount umount> would then fail.

It is admissible (and recommended for conditional mount-points) to check
whether there is any data stored for a certain mount-point.
A function is provided to do this cleanly:

=over 8

=item B<have_stored_data(>I<name of mount-point>B<)>

=back

will return true (B<1>) or false B<('')> depending on whether B<squashmount>
has data stored for that mount-point.
It is recommended to use only this function and the callback
mechanisms described later on when you want to know something about
the data stored by B<squashmount>.

Here is an example which generates a mount-point from a squash-file of a CD
(from a fixed path) only if the option B<-a -c> or B<--arg=--cd> is passed
to B<squashmount>.

=over 8

=item my $cd = '';  # We set $cd = 1 if the mount-point is available

=back

=over 8

=item # Make the mount-point available via options.

=item # (We use B<GetOptions()> here just to illustrate that

=item # B<@ARGV> can be treated with usual perl tools.)

=item Getopt::Long::GetOptions('cd|c', \$cd);

=back

=over 8

=item # The following is important: Make the mount-point available

=item # whenever squashmount has data stored for it.

=item # Thus, the mount-point 'cd' is recognized once it is mounted,

=item # even if you do not pass any special options.

=item # In particular, when the init-system calls B<squashmount stop>,

=item # it will also shut down the mount-point 'cd' properly.

=item $cd ||= have_stored_data('cd');

=back

=over 8

=item # Finally, we (conditionally) add the mount-point to @mounts,

=item # using "standard" paths except for B<FILE>:

=item push(@mounts, standard_mount('cd', '/var/cd', {

=over 16

=item FILE => '/path/to/squashfile/on/cd'

=back

=item })) if($cd);  # under the condition that $cd is true

=back

=over 8

=item # If this is the end of the file, do not forget:

=item 1;  # The last executed command should be a true expression

=back

The callback mechanism mentioned earlier consists in setting at least one of
the variables B<$before>, B<$after>, B<$before_mount>, B<$after_mount>,
B<$before_umount>, $B<$after_umount> to a function or a reference
to an array of functions, respectively.
These functions are called for each mount-point immediately before/after
B<squashmount> executes its main task (specified by B<$command>), or
before/after B<squashmount> is executes its main mount/umount command(s).

Note that e.g. B<$before_mount> can be called several times successively
for the same mount point if B<RESQUASH_ON_START> is true.

These functions are called with three parameters: The name of the mount-point
(a string), a reference to the hash containing the "stored" data,
and a reference to a hash containing the "configuration" data for that
mount-point. These functions should always return B<1> (unless you want
to indicate an error with a special functionality, see below).
Note that the "stored" data usually overrides the "configuration" data.

You can not only read these hashes but also modify them: Modifying data in
a function from B<$before> can influence of course also the behavior of the
subsequent main task, while modifying the hash of "stored" data in a function
from B<$after> only influences what will be stored for later calls of
B<squashmount>. You can add new keys to the hash of "stored" data, but the
values must be very simple: Only strings (or numericals) are admissible.

The modified data is only stored if B<$storing> is true. Changing
the value of B<$storing> in any of the callback functions is not admissible:
If you want to change B<$storing> (and then probably also B<$locking>)
you must do this only when the configuration file is parsed.

Note that all of the hook functions must return a value, and
this value should usually be true (e.g. B<1>): If a function from B<$before>
does not return true, then no further function from B<$before> is executed,
and also the main action of B<squashmount> is not executed for that mount-point
and considered to be failed. If a function from B<$after> does not return
true, then no further function from B<$after> is executed, and
B<squashmount> will not store any data for that mount-point.
Be aware that the latter means that you can run into the same problems
as if you set B<$storing> to a false value: If B<squashmount> just mounted
a mount-point, it will not "know" that it did this afterwards, if the
data is not stored!

In a similar way, a non-true return value of B<$before_mount> or
B<$before_umount> indicates that the (u)mounting failed without actually
attempting to (u)mount, and a non-true return value of B<$after_mount> or
B<$after_umount> indicates that the (u)mounting failed.

In the functions from B<$after>, you should not add/modify any data to the
hash of "stored" data if B<$command> is B<forget> or B<stop>:
Otherwise, the data is stored, as required by you, and so the above mentioned
function B<have_stored_data> will return a true value, contradicting the
documented behavior of B<forget> and B<stop>!

Here is an example which is more advanced than the previous one:
With this example, you can specify the path of the squash-file by
calling B<squashmount> with the arguments B<-a> I<path> or B<--arg=>I<path>.
When mounted, this path will be stored for later usage, until the setting
is forgotten with B<squashmount stop> or B<squashmount forget>.
The mount-point is only visible if either the argument B<-a> is used or if
the path is already stored.

In the above code, the value of B<--arg> is ignored if it is already stored.
This is intentional, since it may be dangerous to change the path of FILE
while it is mounted. A more luxury variant of the above code would also
print a warning if the user attempts to use different values for B<--arg>
without calling B<squashmount stop> (or B<squashmount forget>) in between.

Here is an example of the usage of some of the other hooks.
In this example, the hooks are used to bind a copy of the mounted directory
from the "portage" mount point to /srv/copy
